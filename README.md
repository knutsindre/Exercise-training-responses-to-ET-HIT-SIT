This repository contains the codes and raw data from the manuscript titled: "Effects of exercise training in health and disease on mitochondrial and capillary growth in human skeletal muscle: a systematic review and meta-regression", which is currently under review for publication in Sports Medicine.

1: The "Code" folder included SAS scripts for the various statistical models used in the manuscript. These are also added as text files. 

2: The "Raw data" folder contains the extracted data used for statistical models and data visualization in the manuscript. 

3: The SAS outputs for the various statistical models. Be aware that the effect estimates in the model outputs for log-transformed variables (both dependent and independent variables) need back-transformation before yielding exact results, as presented in the manuscript. % effect = 100*(EKSP(lnEffect/100))-100
